Pinger is nothing but a simple service which pings the urls of the required
websites on-demand and gives you the status of the Service.

A service could be a url like Google.com

The usage of Pinger will be like this:
1)Any user can submit a site like xyz.com
2)In the page containing the list of sites which are submitted, we have button
called "Ping Now" for each webiste. And we have a global button called "Ping All" also, which
ping all the sites at once.
3)Upon receiving the response of any ping, it basically shows 3 types of Flags
4)Red is for "Site is Down"
5)Yellow is for "Slowness in the request/response scenario"
6)Green is for "Site is Up and Running!"
